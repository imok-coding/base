# My Collections and Hobbies

I’m Tyler (im.ok), and this is where I keep everything I’m into and what I’m reading, watching, releasing(music), and collecting. It’s mainly for me, but friends can browse without pinging me for updates.

## What’s here
- Manga: my manga library and wishlist.
- Anime: my MyAnimeList pulls so you can see what I’m watching, finished, or planning.
- TCG: Pokemon, One Piece, and MTG cards and what my collection is worth.
- Music: a feed of my latest tracks across Spotify and SoundCloud.
- Steam: a snapshot of my steam profile and recent playtimes.

That’s it: my shelves, lists, and binders in one place.
